Installing the NIST scan framework
==================================
Below are instructions for performing a full install of the scan framework with applets created
for all features provided by the framework.  The NIST scan framework currently runs under ARTIQ version 3.7 and 
requires Python version 3.5. 

First, create a conda environment with Python version 3.5 and ARTIQ version 3.7 installed.  

```
    conda create -n artiq artiq=3.7 python=3.7
```

Please see [Installing ARTIQ version 3.7](https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-release-3/installing.html) for more detailed
information on installing ARTIQ.

Next, clone the scan_framework repository into a folder that is in your PYTHONPATH and make sure 
the top level folder containing the scan_framework source is named scan_framework.

```
    git clone https://gitlab.nist.gov/gitlab/stylus/scan_framework.git /folder/on/pythonpath
```
    
Next, add the applets listed in [applet_commands.txt](applet_commands.txt) under 
"Applets for the ARTIQ dashboard" to the applets tab in the ARTIQ dashboard.  These applets are used 
to plot the data generated by the scan framework.

Finally, add the applets listed in [applet_commands.txt](applet_commands.txt) under 
"Applets for the ARTIQ browser" to the applets tab in the ARTIQ browser.  These applets are used 
to plot historical scan data in the ARTIQ browser.

Please see the [ARTIQ manual release 3](https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-release-3) for more details on the 
ARTIQ dashboard, ARTIQ browser, and the ```artiq_dashboard``` and ```artiq_browser``` commands.
